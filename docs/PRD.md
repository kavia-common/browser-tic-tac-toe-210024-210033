# Tic Tac Toe Frontend - Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## Executive Summary
This Product Requirements Document defines the scope, objectives, and compliance considerations for the tic_tac_toe_frontend web application. The application provides a browser-based Tic Tac Toe game implemented with React. Although the current codebase is a lightweight React template, this PRD establishes the product direction, requirements, and GxP-aligned controls to guide implementation and validation as features mature. The design adheres to the Ocean Professional theme, prioritizing clarity, accessibility, and a modern UI.

## Goals and Non-Goals
### Goals
- Deliver a responsive React-based Tic Tac Toe game that runs entirely in the browser.
- Provide an intuitive interface with a centered grid, status display, and restart control.
- Implement basic state management for game board, current player, and win/draw detection.
- Align styling with the Ocean Professional theme (blue primary, amber accents, modern minimalism).
- Establish GxP-aligned documentation and scaffolding for audit trail stubs, validation approach, and testing strategy, even though the app is single-user and local.

### Non-Goals
- No backend or persistent storage in the current scope.
- No multiplayer over network in this iteration.
- No PII handling or external authentication in this iteration.
- No external service integration.

## Personas and User Journeys
### Personas
- Casual Player: Wants to quickly play a game of Tic Tac Toe against another local human or a simple AI (future).
- QA/Validator: Verifies that the game behavior, UI, and test coverage meet acceptance and validation criteria.
- Developer/Maintainer: Extends features, maintains code quality, and ensures compliance scaffolding.

### User Journeys
1. Launch Game:
   - User opens the web app and sees a 3x3 board, a status indicator, and a restart button.
2. Make a Move:
   - User clicks a cell to place “X” or “O” depending on turn. The status updates accordingly.
3. Game Progression:
   - The game alternates turns and detects a win or draw. The UI communicates the result.
4. Restart:
   - User clicks restart to reset the board and begin a new game.
5. Theme Toggle (existing template feature):
   - User can toggle light/dark theme for comfort.

## Functional Requirements
Assigning requirement IDs for traceability.

- REQ-001: Display a 3x3 Tic Tac Toe grid centered on the page.
- REQ-002: Track and display current player turn.
- REQ-003: Allow a user to click an empty cell to place their mark (X or O).
- REQ-004: Prevent placing a mark in an occupied cell.
- REQ-005: Detect a win condition and display the winning player.
- REQ-006: Detect a draw condition and display draw status if no moves remain and no winner.
- REQ-007: Provide a restart button that resets the board and game state.
- REQ-008: Provide accessible labels, focus states, and ARIA attributes for interactive elements.
- REQ-009: Provide light/dark theme toggle with persisted selection in state (existing template behavior).
- REQ-010: Adhere to Ocean Professional styling (color palette and modern design cues).
- REQ-011: Provide GxP-compliant scaffolding for audit trail stubs on state changes (frontend-only notes), validation controls for inputs, and error handling stubs.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- NFR-001: Usability and Accessibility
  - Clear status messaging and button labels.
  - Keyboard operable cell selection and restart.
  - High-contrast colors and focus indicators consistent with the theme.
- NFR-002: Performance
  - Immediate UI response for click events.
  - Efficient re-renders limited to affected components.
- NFR-003: Reliability
  - Game logic reliably detects win/draw states.
  - Restart always resets state to initial values.
- NFR-004: Maintainability
  - Clear component structure, small functions with tests.
  - Inline comments and JSDoc for public functions where applicable.
- NFR-005: Security
  - No third-party data exchange.
  - Follow secure coding practices; no user-supplied HTML injection.
- NFR-006: Compliance
  - Documentation aligns with GxP principles where applicable.
  - Testing artifacts link requirements to tests (traceability).

## GxP Compliance Mapping (ALCOA+)
Note: The app is currently a local, single-user frontend with no external data persistence. The following mappings define expectations and stubs for future scalability:
- Attributable:
  - When access controls are introduced (future), attribution must be tied to a user identity. For now, a stubbed audit trail can capture a session identifier and timestamps for actions such as restart and moves.
- Legible:
  - Code and documentation are written clearly with consistent naming. Public functions include comments.
- Contemporaneous:
  - State changes (move placement, restart) can be accompanied by real-time audit-log stubs at the frontend layer (console logs during development; structured logging in future).
- Original:
  - For future backend integration, ensure origin of audit entries is the authoritative source. Currently, no persisted data exists.
- Accurate:
  - Game rules enforce valid move positions and alternate turns. Tests verify accuracy of outcomes.
- Complete:
  - All game events that affect state (e.g., move, restart) should have corresponding audit entries (stubbed in this frontend context).
- Consistent:
  - UI consistently shows the current player and game status. State transitions are predictable.
- Enduring:
  - For future persistence, ensure enduring storage of audit logs/server-side data. Not applicable in current frontend-only scope.
- Available:
  - Future access controls and role-based views are planned for when multi-user or sensitive functionality is introduced.

## Risk Assessment and Mitigations
- R-001: Incorrect win detection leads to wrong outcomes.
  - Mitigation: Unit tests for all win paths and draw states; code review.
- R-002: Accessibility gaps.
  - Mitigation: Add ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, and high-contrast styling; run automated a11y checks where feasible.
- R-003: Incomplete audit trail in frontend-only context.
  - Mitigation: Implement structured audit stubs and document limitations pending any backend.
- R-004: Theme toggle conflicts with game UI visibility.
  - Mitigation: Test visibility and contrast in both themes; align colors with Ocean Professional palette.

## Release Gate Checklist
- [ ] All functional requirements implemented (REQ-001 to REQ-011 as applicable).
- [ ] Linting and tests passing with targeted coverage.
- [ ] Accessibility review completed.
- [ ] GxP-aligned documentation updated (PRD, Architecture, Testing Strategy, Traceability).
- [ ] Traceability matrix updated linking requirements to implementation and tests.
- [ ] Known limitations documented.

## Open Questions and Assumptions
- Assumption: Single-session, single-user game without authentication in current scope.
- Assumption: No persistence or backend logging; “audit” is a frontend stub only.
- Open Question: Will future iterations include user accounts and server-side audit trail?
- Open Question: Should a basic AI opponent be included in a future milestone?

## Style Guide Alignment (Ocean Professional theme)
- Primary color: #2563EB; Secondary/Accent: #F59E0B; Error: #EF4444; Background: #f9fafb; Surface: #ffffff; Text: #111827.
- Styling:
  - Centered grid layout with status above and restart below.
  - Subtle shadows, rounded corners, minimalist design.
  - Smooth transitions and subtle gradients for depth.
- Accessibility:
  - Ensure sufficient color contrast and visible focus rings.
  - Provide ARIA roles and labels for board cells and controls.

## Acceptance Criteria
- The application displays a centered 3x3 board and allows alternate turns.
- Win and draw states are detected and displayed.
- Restart button resets the game state.
- Theme toggle functions without impairing readability.
- GxP compliance sections and documentation are provided in this PRD and the Architecture/Testing docs.
- Traceability matrix exists with REQ-IDs linked to implementation and tests, updated as code evolves.
