# Tic Tac Toe Frontend - Testing Strategy

## Overview
This document outlines the testing approach for the tic_tac_toe_frontend React application, aligning with GxP testing requirements. Although the app is a client-only SPA, we adopt rigorous testing to validate functional correctness, accessibility, and compliance scaffolding.

## Objectives
- Achieve strong coverage of game logic and UI interactions.
- Ensure reliability of win/draw detection and restart behavior.
- Verify accessibility and theme contrast.
- Provide traceability from requirements to tests.

## Test Levels

### Unit Tests
Scope:
- Pure functions for move validation, win/draw detection (to be added).
- Component-level behavior using React Testing Library.
Targets:
- REQ-001 to REQ-007: Board rendering, interactions, state updates.
- REQ-009: Theme toggle behavior.
Practices:
- Happy path and edge cases (illegal moves, post-game clicks ignored).
- Use Jest and React Testing Library (already set up via react-scripts).
Coverage:
- Aim for >= 80% statements/branches for game logic and core components.

### Integration Tests (where applicable)
Scope:
- Composition of App with Board, Status, Controls.
- State propagation between components (props/state).
Note:
- With no backend, integration focuses on intra-component interactions.

### Validation Tests (GxP)
Scope:
- Requirements mapping (TRACEABILITY.md).
- Data integrity checks: no overwriting cells, deterministic outcomes.
- Audit trail stub checks: ensure structured events are emitted on actions (frontend scoped).
- Accessibility checks: ARIA roles/labels for cells and controls; keyboard navigation.
Artifacts:
- Link Test IDs (TC-XXX) to REQ-XXX in TRACEABILITY.md.

### Performance Tests
Scope:
- Render responsiveness under typical usage.
- No heavy computation expected; ensure that re-renders remain snappy.

## Test Data
- Deterministic sequences of moves to validate each win path (rows, columns, diagonals).
- Sequences forcing a draw.
- Invalid actions: clicking same cell twice, clicking after game end.

## Tooling
- Jest runner with react-scripts test.
- React Testing Library for DOM interaction.
- jest-dom for assertions.
- Optional a11y checks via axe (future enhancement).

## Example Test Skeletons
```javascript
// src/__tests__/game.spec.js
// REQ-003, REQ-004, REQ-005, REQ-006
describe('TicTacToe Game Logic', () => {
  test('places mark on empty cell (REQ-003)', () => {
    // implement when Board/Cell exists
  });
  test('prevents overwriting a cell (REQ-004)', () => {
    // implement
  });
  test('detects win (REQ-005)', () => {
    // implement
  });
  test('detects draw (REQ-006)', () => {
    // implement
  });
});
```

## Acceptance and Exit Criteria
- Unit tests cover all functional requirements with >= 80% coverage for core game logic.
- Integration tests validate component composition and state propagation.
- Validation tests verify compliance scaffolding and accessibility.
- Traceability matrix is updated with test references.
- All tests pass in CI and locally.

## Reporting and Traceability
- Each test links back to REQ-XXX in its title or comment.
- TRACEABILITY.md lists TC-IDs aligned to REQ-IDs.
- Include coverage reports generated by Jest (optional configuration).

## Maintenance
- Update tests when requirements or implementation change.
- Keep test names stable to preserve traceability links.
